# Basic-Autocoder-Architecture
This notebook showcases my attempt to code various autoencoder architectures using PyTorch. It includes linear, convolutional linear, non-linear convolutional, and MLP autoencoders on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to enhance my PyTorch skills and deepen my understanding of key deep learning concepts.
